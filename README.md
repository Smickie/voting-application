# voting-application
 Voting application project made with ChatGPT

The purpose of this project was to practice using ChatGPT to assist us in how to plan, manage and write our code. By doing so, we also learn about how to prompt LLM's to help us better reach the vision of our projects.

In this case, the code is a simple voting program inspired by the very specific and unique rules used on wednesdays in the Nod Coding Bootcamp where we have lunch together at a restaurant nearby. Anyone can suggest resturants in the nearby area and each person in the class casts one votes each but in two consecutive rounds. The restaurant with the highest votes wins. 

The application is console based only for now, simply run the program and follow the instructions prompted. Ensure that the spelling in the different inputs is correct, especially during the voting process. 

It was a fine project to practice prompting ChatGPT in helping create a plan with the unique ruleset of the vote, using mostly back and forth prompting to achieve the optimal structure of our functions.
